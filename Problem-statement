Create AWS resource thriugh terraform. 

•There should be an S3 bucket referenced in Terraform as bucket and named upload-bucket. The ACL should be private 0.
• There should be an SQS queue referenced in Terraform as queue and named upload-queue.
• The above queue should have a delay specified as 60 seconds, a max message size of 8kB, should discard messages after 48 hours and should wait for up to 15 seconds for messages to be received.
• There should be an IAM policy document created as Terraform data referenced as iam_notify-policy-doc which should describe the policy that will be used by the bucket notification hook to post messages to the queue, or you can use EOF expression in policy and omit this step.
• The above document should contain one statement with id equal to 10 .
• The above statement should work only for upload-bucket o and it should be tested by checking if the source ARN matches.
• The above statement should work only on upload-queue and it should allow messages to be sent to it.
• The above statement should use the AWS type of principal with identifiers set to * 0 .
• The above document should be used to create the upload-queue policy referenced in Terraform as notif_policy . You may as well use inline policy implementing the same thing instead of using policy document.
• Finally, bucket notification should be enabled (referenced in Terraform as bucket_notif @ ) to send a message to upload-queue o when an object is created in upload-bucket .
• All references to other resources should be specified as Terraform identifiers, not as text.
